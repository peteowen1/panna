\alias{scrape_understat_fixtures}
\title{Scrape fixtures from Understat league page}
\usage{
scrape_understat_fixtures(league, season, completed_only = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{league}{League code (e.g., "ENG", "ESP")}

\item{season}{Season year (e.g., 2024 or "2024")}

\item{completed_only}{If TRUE, only return completed matches (default TRUE)}
}
\value{
Data frame with match info including understat_id, or NULL if
data cannot be extracted (expected for current Understat site structure)
}
\description{
Gets list of matches with Understat IDs for a league and season.
}
\note{
As of 2024, Understat loads fixture data via JavaScript. This function
will return NULL because the data is not in the initial HTML response.
Use \code{scrape_understat_match_range()} as an alternative to scrape
matches by ID range, or use RSelenium/chromote for JS-rendered content.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# This will likely return NULL due to JS-loaded content
fixtures <- scrape_understat_fixtures("ENG", 2024)

# Alternative: use match ID range
results <- scrape_understat_match_range(28900, 28910, "ENG", 2024)
}
}
