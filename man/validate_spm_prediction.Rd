\title{Validate SPM prediction accuracy}
\usage{
validate_spm_prediction(
  spm_ratings,
  rapm_ratings,
  weight_by_minutes = TRUE,
  weight_transform = "sqrt"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{spm_ratings}{Data frame with SPM predictions (must include total_minutes for weighting)}

\item{rapm_ratings}{Data frame with actual RAPM}

\item{weight_by_minutes}{Whether to weight metrics by minutes (default TRUE)}

\item{weight_transform}{Transform for weights: "sqrt" (default), "linear", "log"}
}
\value{
List with validation metrics (both weighted and unweighted)
}
\description{
Assesses how well SPM predicts RAPM. Supports weighted metrics to match
weighted model fitting - we care more about accuracy for high-minute players
whose RAPM estimates are more reliable.
