\usage{
create_splint_boundaries(
  events,
  shots = NULL,
  include_goals = TRUE,
  include_halftime = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{events}{Data frame of match events (with minute and optionally added_time columns)}

\item{shots}{Data frame of shots (optional, with minute column for stoppage time)}

\item{include_goals}{Logical, whether to create new splints at goals (default TRUE)}

\item{include_halftime}{Logical, whether to create splint at halftime (default TRUE)}
}
\value{
Data frame of splint boundaries with game state
}
\description{
Defines start and end times for each splint based on events and optionally shots.
Splints are created at:
\itemize{
\item Start of match (minute 0)
\item Each goal
\item Each substitution
\item Each red card
\item Half time (minute 45)
\item End of match (dynamically calculated from stoppage time in events/shots)
}
}
\details{
Uses continuous time where second-half events are offset by first-half stoppage.
Example with 3 mins first-half stoppage and 11 mins second-half stoppage:
\itemize{
\item First half: 0 to 48 (45 + 3)
\item Second half: 48 to 104 (offset by 3, plus 90+11)
}

Also tracks game state (cumulative goals, red cards, player counts) at each splint boundary.
