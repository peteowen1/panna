\title{Extract xRAPM ratings (with prior)}
\usage{
extract_xrapm_ratings(model, lambda = "min")
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{Fitted xRAPM model from fit_rapm_with_prior}

\item{lambda}{Which lambda to use ("min" or "1se")}
}
\value{
Data frame with player ratings including deviation from prior
}
\description{
Extracts player ratings from a model fit with SPM prior.
The final coefficient is gamma + prior, where gamma is the deviation.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
xrapm_model <- fit_rapm_with_prior(rapm_data, offense_prior, defense_prior)
ratings <- extract_xrapm_ratings(xrapm_model, lambda = "min")
head(ratings)
