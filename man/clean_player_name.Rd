\title{Clean player name for matching}
\usage{
clean_player_name(names)
}
\arguments{
\item{names}{Character vector of player names}
}
\value{
Character vector of cleaned names (lowercase, no whitespace)
}
\description{
Creates a minimal normalized version of player name for fuzzy matching.
Unlike standardize_player_names() which preserves readable format,
this creates a key: lowercase with all whitespace removed.
Uses memoization to cache unique names for O(1) lookup on repeated values.
}
\examples{
clean_player_name(c("Kylian Mbappé", "kylian mbappé", "KYLIAN MBAPPÉ"))
# All return "kylianmbappé"
}
