\title{Normalize SPADL Coordinates}
\usage{
normalize_spadl_coordinates(dt)
}
\arguments{
\item{dt}{Data.table in SPADL format (modified in place)}
}
\value{
Data.table with normalized coordinates (same object, modified)
}
\description{
WARNING: This function uses a heuristic that doesn't work well with Opta's
team-relative coordinate system. For EPV modeling, use normalize_direction=FALSE
(the default) to preserve Opta's native coordinates where each team's actions
are from their own perspective.
}
\details{
Attempts to flip coordinates so all teams attack toward x=100. Uses mean
position per team/period as a heuristic, but this fails when both teams have
similar mean positions or when coordinates are team-relative.
