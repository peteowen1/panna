\title{Prepare Pass Data for xPass Model}
\usage{
prepare_passes_for_xpass(spadl_actions)
}
\arguments{
\item{spadl_actions}{SPADL actions data frame with pass events}
}
\value{
Data frame with pass features:
\itemize{
\item start_x, start_y: Pass origin coordinates
\item end_x, end_y: Pass destination coordinates
\item pass_distance: Euclidean distance
\item pass_angle: Angle of pass relative to goal direction
\item is_forward: Pass moves toward opponent goal
\item is_progressive: Significant forward movement
\item start_zone, end_zone: Pitch zones
\item crosses_midfield: Pass crosses halfway line
\item into_penalty_area: Pass ends in penalty area
\item into_final_third: Pass ends in final third
\item pass_type_*: Pass type indicators
\item completed: Target variable (1 = successful pass)
}
}
\description{
Creates features for pass completion probability modeling from SPADL actions.
Optimized with data.table for fast processing.
