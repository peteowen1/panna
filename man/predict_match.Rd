}
\arguments{
\item{goals_home_model}{Fitted XGBoost Poisson model for home goals}

\item{goals_away_model}{Fitted XGBoost Poisson model for away goals}

\item{outcome_model}{Fitted XGBoost multinomial model}

\item{X_goals}{Feature matrix for goals models}

\item{X_outcome}{Feature matrix for outcome model (without goal predictions)}
}
\value{
Data frame with pred_home_goals, pred_away_goals, prob_H, prob_D, prob_A
}
\description{
Given fitted goals and outcome models, predicts P(H), P(D), P(A) and
expected goals for a set of matches.
