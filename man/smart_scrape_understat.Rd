\title{Smart scrape Understat with per-league tracking}
\usage{
smart_scrape_understat(
  manifest_path,
  leagues = c("RUS", "ENG", "ESP", "FRA", "ITA", "GER"),
  lookback = 20,
  max_misses = 25,
  delay = 3,
  verbose = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{manifest_path}{Path to manifest parquet file}

\item{leagues}{Character vector of leagues to scrape (default: all 6)}

\item{lookback}{Number of IDs to look back from max (handles gaps)}

\item{max_misses}{Stop scanning a league after this many consecutive misses}

\item{delay}{Seconds between requests}

\item{verbose}{Print progress messages}
}
\value{
Data frame with scraping results (match_id, league, status)
}
\description{
Scrapes Understat matches using per-league max ID tracking. Each league
is scanned independently from its own max ID, which handles the interleaved
nature of Understat match IDs across leagues.
