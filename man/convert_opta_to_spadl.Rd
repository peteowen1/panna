\title{Convert Opta Match Events to SPADL Format}
\usage{
convert_opta_to_spadl(opta_events, normalize_direction = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{opta_events}{Data frame from load_opta_match_events()}

\item{normalize_direction}{Whether to attempt coordinate normalization. Set
to FALSE (default) to preserve Opta's team-relative coordinates, which is
correct for EPV. Set to TRUE only for visualizations requiring unified
pitch coordinates (note: the normalization heuristic may not work well
with team-relative data).}
}
\value{
Data frame in SPADL format with columns:
\itemize{
\item match_id: Match identifier
\item action_id: Sequential action number within match
\item period_id: 1=first half, 2=second half
\item time_seconds: Time in seconds from period start
\item team_id: Team performing action
\item player_id: Player performing action
\item player_name: Player name
\item start_x, start_y: Starting coordinates (0-100)
\item end_x, end_y: Ending coordinates (0-100)
\item action_type: Standardized action type
\item action_type_id: Numeric action type code
\item opta_type_id: Original Opta type_id (e.g., 13=saved, 15=missed, 16=goal)
\item result: "success" or "fail"
\item bodypart: "foot", "head", or "other"
\item receiver_player_id: Player who receives/intercepts (from next action)
\item receiver_player_name: Name of receiver/interceptor
\item receiver_team_id: Team of receiver (for detecting possession change)
\item possession_change: TRUE if next action is by opponent team
}
}
\description{
Transforms Opta event data into a standardized SPADL-like format suitable
for EPV modeling. Coordinates are preserved in Opta's native team-relative
format where each team's actions are from their own perspective (x=0 is own
goal, x=100 is opponent's goal). This is the correct format for EPV models
where each action is evaluated from the ball-carrier's perspective.
