\title{Convert Opta Match Events to SPADL Format}
\usage{
convert_opta_to_spadl(opta_events, normalize_direction = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{opta_events}{Data frame from load_opta_match_events()}

\item{normalize_direction}{Whether to flip coordinates so attacking team
always goes left-to-right (default TRUE)}
}
\value{
Data frame in SPADL format with columns:
\itemize{
\item match_id: Match identifier
\item action_id: Sequential action number within match
\item period_id: 1=first half, 2=second half
\item time_seconds: Time in seconds from period start
\item team_id: Team performing action
\item player_id: Player performing action
\item player_name: Player name
\item start_x, start_y: Starting coordinates (0-100)
\item end_x, end_y: Ending coordinates (0-100)
\item action_type: Standardized action type
\item action_type_id: Numeric action type code
\item result: "success" or "fail"
\item bodypart: "foot", "head", or "other"
\item receiver_player_id: Player who receives/intercepts (from next action)
\item receiver_player_name: Name of receiver/interceptor
\item receiver_team_id: Team of receiver (for detecting possession change)
\item possession_change: TRUE if next action is by opponent team
}
}
\description{
Transforms Opta event data into a standardized SPADL-like format suitable
for EPV modeling. Normalizes coordinates so teams always attack left-to-right
and standardizes action types across different event categories.

events <- load_opta_match_events("ENG", "2024-2025")
