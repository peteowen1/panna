\title{Aggregate Player EPV Metrics}
\usage{
aggregate_player_epv(spadl_with_epv, lineups = NULL, min_minutes = 450)
}
\arguments{
\item{spadl_with_epv}{SPADL actions with EPV and credit columns}

\item{lineups}{Optional lineup data for minutes played}

\item{min_minutes}{Minimum minutes for inclusion (default 450)}
}
\value{
Data frame with player EPV statistics:

\item player_id, player_name, team_id
\item n_actions, total_minutes (if available)
\item epv_total: Total EPV contribution
\item epv_p90: EPV per 90 minutes
\item epv_as_actor: EPV from own actions (player_credit)
\item epv_as_receiver: EPV from receiving (successful passes + turnovers won)
\item epv_duel_blame: EPV from losing duels (negative, summed from opponent_credit)
\item epv_passing, epv_shooting, epv_dribbling, epv_defending
