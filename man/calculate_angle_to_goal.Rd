\title{Calculate Angle to Goal}
\usage{
calculate_angle_to_goal(x, y, goal_width = 12)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{X coordinate (0-100 scale, attacking toward x=100)}

\item{y}{Y coordinate (0-100 scale, y=50 is center of pitch)}

\item{goal_width}{Goal width in coordinate units (default ~12 for standard goal)}
}
\value{
Angle to goal in radians (always positive)
}
\description{
Calculates the visible angle (in radians) to the goal from given coordinates.
The angle represents how much of the goal is visible from the player's position.
Useful for shot xG models.
}
\examples{
calculate_angle_to_goal(90, 50)  # Central, close - large angle
calculate_angle_to_goal(90, 80)  # Wide position - smaller angle
calculate_angle_to_goal(50, 50)  # Halfway line - small angle
}
