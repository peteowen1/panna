\title{Extract Shots from xG-Scored SPADL for Splint Pipeline}
\usage{
extract_shots_from_spadl(spadl, lineups)
}
\arguments{
\item{spadl}{SPADL actions data frame with \code{xg} and \code{is_penalty} columns
(from \code{add_xg_to_spadl()} and penalty detection).}

\item{lineups}{Lineup data from \code{load_opta_lineups()} for team_name mapping.}
}
\value{
Data frame with one row per shot containing:
\itemize{
\item match_id, minute, team, player_id, player_name
\item xg: Model-predicted xG (penalties overridden to 0.76)
\item is_goal: Whether the shot resulted in a goal
\item is_penalty: Whether the shot was a penalty
}
}
\description{
Extracts shot rows from SPADL data that has been scored with xG predictions,
and formats them for the splint creation pipeline. This bridges the xMetrics
infrastructure (SPADL + xG model) with the RAPM/splint pipeline.
