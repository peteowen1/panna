\title{Calculate blended SPM ratings from Elastic Net and XGBoost}
\usage{
calculate_spm_blend(
  player_features,
  model_glmnet,
  model_xgb,
  weight_glmnet = 0.5
)
}
\arguments{
\item{player_features}{Data frame of player features}

\item{model_glmnet}{Fitted Elastic Net SPM model from fit_spm_model}

\item{model_xgb}{Fitted XGBoost SPM model from fit_spm_xgb}

\item{weight_glmnet}{Weight for Elastic Net predictions (default 0.5)}
}
\value{
Data frame with blended SPM ratings plus individual model predictions
}
\description{
Combines predictions from both model types with configurable weighting.
The blend can improve robustness by capturing both linear (Elastic Net)
and non-linear (XGBoost) relationships between box scores and RAPM.
