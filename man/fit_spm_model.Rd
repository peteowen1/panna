\usage{
fit_spm_model(
  data,
  predictor_cols = NULL,
  alpha = 0.5,
  nfolds = 10,
  weight_by_minutes = TRUE,
  weight_transform = "sqrt"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Data frame from prepare_spm_regression_data or aggregate_player_stats
joined with RAPM ratings}

\item{predictor_cols}{Character vector of predictor column names}

\item{alpha}{Elastic net mixing (0=ridge, 1=lasso, default 0.5)}

\item{nfolds}{Number of CV folds}

\item{weight_by_minutes}{Whether to weight observations by total_minutes (default TRUE).
Reduces influence of noisy low-minute estimates on model coefficients.}

\item{weight_transform}{How to transform minutes for weighting:
"sqrt" (default) - square root of minutes (moderate weighting)
"linear" - raw minutes (strong weighting toward high-minute players)
"log" - log of minutes (gentle weighting)
"none" - equal weights}
}
\value{
Fitted glmnet model with metadata
}
\description{
Fits an elastic net model predicting RAPM from box score statistics.
Weights observations by minutes played (sqrt transform) by default to reduce
influence of noisy low-minute players whose RAPM and per-90 stats are unreliable.
