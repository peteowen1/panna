}
\arguments{
\item{spadl_with_epv}{SPADL actions with EPV values from calculate_action_epv()}

\item{xpass_model}{Optional xPass model for pass difficulty weighting}
}
\value{
SPADL actions with credit columns added:
\itemize{
\item player_credit: EPV credit to acting player
\item receiver_credit: EPV credit to receiver (for turnovers, this is positive)

\description{
Assigns EPV credit/blame to players. For turnovers (possession changes),
splits the value between the player who lost the ball and who gained it.
For merged duels (Aerials, Take On vs Tackle), assigns zero-sum credit
where winner gain = loser loss.
