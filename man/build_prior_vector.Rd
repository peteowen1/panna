\title{Build prior vector for RAPM from SPM predictions}
\usage{
build_prior_vector(spm_data, spm_col, player_mapping, default = 0)
}
\arguments{
\item{spm_data}{Data frame with player_name and the SPM column to use}

\item{spm_col}{Name of the column containing SPM predictions}

\item{player_mapping}{Data frame with player_id and player_name from RAPM}

\item{default}{Value for players without SPM prediction (default 0)}
}
\value{
Named vector of priors keyed by player_id
}
\description{
Creates a named prior vector aligned with player IDs from SPM rating predictions.
This is a vectorized helper used by xRAPM and seasonal ratings to build priors
from SPM predictions without manual for-loops.
}

  spm_data = offense_spm_ratings,
  spm_col = "offense_spm",
