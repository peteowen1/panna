\title{Build Consolidated Parquet Files for Remote Queries}
\usage{
build_consolidated_parquet(
  table_types = NULL,
  output_dir = NULL,
  verbose = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{table_types}{Character vector of table types to consolidate.
Defaults to all FBref table types.}

\item{output_dir}{Directory to write consolidated parquet files.
Defaults to pannadata_dir()/consolidated.}

\item{verbose}{Print progress messages.}
}
\value{
Data frame with table_type, n_rows, size_mb columns.
}
\description{
Creates a single parquet file per table type containing ALL leagues and seasons.
These consolidated files are uploaded to GitHub releases for fast remote querying
(like bouncer's approach). Users can then filter by league/season in SQL.
}
\details{
This function reads all the individual league/season parquet files for each
table type and combines them into a single file. The resulting files can be
uploaded directly to GitHub releases as individual assets, enabling fast
remote queries via \code{query_remote_parquet()}.

Output files are named \code{{table_type}.parquet} (e.g., \code{summary.parquet}).
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Build all consolidated parquets
build_consolidated_parquet()

# Build only summary and events
build_consolidated_parquet(table_types = c("summary", "events"))
}
}
