# Load Opta xG/xA/xPass Player Metrics

Loads pre-computed player-level xG, xA, and xPass metrics from parquet
files. These are generated by the 03_calculate_player_xmetrics.R
pipeline script which applies trained xG/xPass models to all Opta event
data.

## Usage

``` r
load_opta_xmetrics(league, season = NULL, columns = NULL, source = c("local"))
```

## Arguments

- league:

  League code (e.g., "ENG", "EPL").

- season:

  Optional season filter (e.g., "2024-2025").

- columns:

  Optional character vector of columns to select.

- source:

  Data source: only "local" is supported (xmetrics are
  pipeline-generated, not available in GitHub releases).

## Value

Data frame with player xmetrics including xg, npxg, xa, xpass stats.

## Examples

``` r
if (FALSE) { # \dontrun{
# Load EPL xmetrics
epl_xm <- load_opta_xmetrics("ENG", season = "2024-2025")

# Top xG players
head(epl_xm[order(-epl_xm$xg), c("player_name", "team_name", "xg", "goals")])
} # }
```
