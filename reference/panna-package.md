# panna: Player Rating System for Football Using RAPM and SPM Methods

Implements player ratings for football (soccer) using Regularized
Adjusted Plus-Minus ('RAPM') combined with Statistical Plus-Minus
('SPM') as a Bayesian prior. Analyses time segments with constant
lineups ('splints') to estimate each player's contribution to expected
goals ('xG') differential. Provides offensive and defensive rating
decomposition across multiple data sources including 'FBref', 'Opta',
and 'Understat'.
