    person("Pete", "Owen", , "pete.owen1@hotmail.co.uk", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: Implements the panna player rating methodology for football
    (soccer) players. Combines Regularized Adjusted Plus-Minus (RAPM) with
    Statistical Plus-Minus (SPM) as a Bayesian prior to produce stable player
    impact ratings. Uses cached FBref data from pannadata repository,
    splint-based analysis (time segments between substitutions/goals), and
    offensive/defensive rating separation.
